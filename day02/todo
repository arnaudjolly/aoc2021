Some ideas to play with:

- create some classes for each command (Forward, Up, Down) which will have an "applyOn" method that takes a state and returns the new state.
 pros: reduce will be simpler, 
 cons: as the behavior is not the same in part1 and 2, we will have to create 2 methods: part1ApplyOn, part2ApplyOn
